*The thesis of this essay is technology trees, as frequently seen in strategy computer games, espouse the nuanced form of objectivism used by Alan Chalmers in an account of theory change in physics. In other words, it’s a crash course in philosophical objectivism for people who like games like StarCraft and Age of Empires.*

If you’ve ever played a real-time or turn-based strategy game, you’re probably familiar with the [tech tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_tree).
