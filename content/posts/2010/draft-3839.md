I once complained to Ken that it seemed in order to get a paper published (in this case, the topic was session types—an avenue of inquiry that I have put on hold pending further training in theory and a better substrate to build the system on), I had to do all sorts of rigorous proof writing of certain properties, which I didn’t have much experience in. It wasn't that I discounted the importance of such practice: I hear there have been cases in which we *thought* a type system was sound but then when we actually worked it out it wasn’t, but it’s a pretty substantial hurdle for a new practitioner; they have to study the existing techniques and get acquainted with the style of proof expected of these papers. Ken summed it up and said that sometimes, in order to get a paper published, you have to do extra things that are totally uninteresting to you.

I filed away this exchange and didn’t think about it for some time, but it came up again when I was reading [this blog post](http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2009/12/text-book-algorithms-at-soda-guest-post.html). It was an appeal for simplification of papers, that papers these days piled on pages and pages of “complications” that obscured the good idea and made it difficult for practitioners to take your work and apply it. It reminded me of [Simon Peyton Jone’s talk](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk.htm) about how to write a good paper: you want to convey *your idea* and so you should first focus on communicating intuition before getting down to the details. This is certainly not common practice: when I read academic papers I have to employ all manner of tricks to mentally filter out as many of the details of possible so that I can get the overall structure of the idea, which is invariably stretched out across the entire paper. Oh, you’re introducing a new hash function with your paper? Why do I have to scan until page seven to find what the function actually is?

It then occurred to me that there were two conflicting aims of the academic paper. One was that you wanted to spread your idea: this involves *teaching*, and all of the complexities and techniques associated with it. The other was that you wanted to get it accepted into a conference: this involved *expressing novelty* and showing the contribution was *nontrivial*. They really don’t have much to do with each other at all.
