        Congratulations! 
        
        It sounds like Galois is a very good fit for you.
        
        Any thoughts as to where you'd like to do your PhD?

I'm happy to report that I'll be interning at [Galois](http://www.galois.com/) over the summer. I'm not quite sure how the name of the company passed into my consciousness, but at some point in January I decided it would be really cool to work at an all-Haskell shop, and began pestering Don Stewart (and Galois's HR) for the next two months.

I'll be working on some project within Cryptol; there were a few specific project ideas tossed around though it's not clear if they'll have already finished one of my projects by the time the summer rolls around. I'm also really looking forward to working in an environment with a much higher emphasis towards research, since I need to figure out if I'm going to start gunning for a PhD program at the end of my undergraduate program.

Hello, Portland! I can't wait. :-)
