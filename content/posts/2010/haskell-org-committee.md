Ever try to go to haskell.org and notice that it was down? Well, now you have someone to complain to: the [haskell.org committee](http://haskellorg.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/the-haskell-org-committee-has-formed/) has formed and apparently I’m on it. `8-)`

One of the first things we’ll be doing is moving haskell.org from a server being hosted at Yale (the hosting has been good, but what will happen is the server will go down during the weekend and there will be no one to kick it until Monday) to some [dedicated hardware](http://new-www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell). I must admit, I do feel a bit sheepish for being on the committee but not having any bits (or direct experience) to help do the maintenance work—hopefully that will change soon.
