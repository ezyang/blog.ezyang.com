<p>Suggested by Oleksandr Manzyuk</p>

<p>This one's a toughie. What kind of stories are interesting and I can tell? What level of detail? Am I trying to spin the stories or tell them just because they're interesting?</p>

<p>Possibilities:</p>

<p>* First day at Galois, Levent introduces me to Cryptol, I spend the day setting up GHC on my Mac OS X</p>

<p>* Industrial research in a small company: MOB meetings, chasing down contracts</p>

<p>* All-hands meeting: appreciations as an amazing part of company culture (praise in public, criticize in private)</p>

<p>* Sean Weaver comes to town: someone else works with the software that I'm using!</p>

<p>* Snuggled up on a couch with the Verilog book, realizing what Cryptol is actually trying to do</p>

<p>* Ping pong with Eric, Launchbury and Trevor</p>

<p>* Second Friday Game Night (first night at Adam Wick's; second night at Sally Browning's)</p>

<p>* "I had fun hacking on the type system," conversations with Iavor</p>

<p>* Don Stewart in person, the random monad hacking session</p>

<p>* Walk over to their desk and take a look kind of culture (debugging things with Ledah and Trevor)</p>

<p>* John Matthews clarifying how to handle adding constraints to SAT graph</p>

<p>* Big codebase can be kind of fuzzy! But I was up and hacking on it in no time, which says something about the types.</p>

<p>* Pains with big codebases: import hell, functions from fifty different files cutting across all concerns. Abstraction ignorance when working on a codebase that does things you've never formally taken a CS course in (what is an IR? Oh, Intermediate Representation. Metacircular evaluator ain't gonna cut it.)</p>

<p>* RSA and JAIG lol.</p>
