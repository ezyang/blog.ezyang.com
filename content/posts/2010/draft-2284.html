This one's a toughie. What kind of stories are interesting and I can tell? What level of detail? Am I trying to spin the stories or tell them just because they're interesting?

Possibilities:

* First day at Galois, Levent introduces me to Cryptol, I spend the day setting up GHC on my Mac OS X

* Industrial research in a small company: MOB meetings, chasing down contracts

* All-hands meeting: appreciations as an amazing part of company culture (praise in public, criticize in private)

* Sean Weaver comes to town: someone else works with the software that I'm using!

* Snuggled up on a couch with the Verilog book, realizing what Cryptol is actually trying to do

* Ping pong with Eric, Launchbury and Trevor

* Second Friday Game Night (first night at Adam Wick's; second night at Sally Browning's)

* "I had fun hacking on the type system," conversations with Iavor

* Don Stewart in person, the random monad hacking session

* Walk over to their desk and take a look kind of culture (debugging things with Ledah and Trevor)

* John Matthews clarifying how to handle adding constraints to SAT graph

* Big codebase can be kind of fuzzy! But I was up and hacking on it in no time, which says something about the types.

* Pains with big codebases: import hell, functions from fifty different files cutting across all concerns. Abstraction ignorance when working on a codebase that does things you've never formally taken a CS course in (what is an IR? Oh, Intermediate Representation. Metacircular evaluator ain't gonna cut it.)

* RSA and JAIG lol.
