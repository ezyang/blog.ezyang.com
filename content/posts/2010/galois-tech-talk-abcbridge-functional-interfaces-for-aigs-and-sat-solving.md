Yesterday I gave a [Galois Tech Talk](http://www.galois.com/blog/2010/08/19/tech-talk-abcbridge-functional-interfaces-for-aigs-and-sat-solving/) about abcBridge, a set of bindings in Haskell for [ABC](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/) that I built over the summer as part of my internship.

There should be a video soon, but until then, you can [download my annotated slides](http://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/galois.pdf). The software’s not public yet, but hopefully it will be soon.
