<p>Unattributed to protect the innocent. (But you can probably guess.)</p>

<p>“And so these poor programmers, they had to drink this much whiskey to get the job done.” [triumphantly produces a bottle of whiskey and places it on the table.] “And this group of programmers did X, and how hard was that? Two bottles of whiskey.” [places two more bottles of whiskey on the table] “But that wasn’t fast enough. And so this group of programmers did Y. Four bottles of whiskey.” [four more bottles appear] “As you can see, this is requiring an exponentially increasing amount of whiskey.”</p>

<p>“Locks and semaphores are Soviet-era technology.”</p>

<p>On the subject of optimizing algorithms by porting them to lower level hardware description languages: “There are much more productive things for you young PhD students to be doing.”</p>

<p>On Tycho Brahe: “Drunk. Irascible. Fat. Brilliant. Definitely a role model.”</p>

<p>“One of the benefits of Hindley-Milner inference is that it’s quite efficient.” “You mean EXPTIME-complete.”</p>

<p>“Any god-fearing man should write his type signatures.”</p>

<p>On the absence of let generalization in GHC 7.0: “It’s not a feature, it’s a bug with benefits.”</p>

<p>“You would think that explicit type signatures would make the type checker’s job easier, but actually they are making the checker’s job harder.”</p>

<p>“I strongly recommend this paper, but do carry along a jar of aspirin.”</p>
