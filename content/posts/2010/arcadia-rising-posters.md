As treasurer for the Assassins' Guild, I often have to beg and plead GMs to get posters for their respective games, since the UA Finboard has a requirement that, to get funding for events, you need to supply posters.

So I was quite surprised, amazed and impressed by Lauren Gust's work on posters for Arcadia. The composition is simple, but effective, and definitely adds to the atmosphere of the game. Click for larger versions, and you can get full size PDFs of the posters in [Lauren Gust's public](http://web.mit.edu/~lgust/Public/arcadia). For a little more background into what the posters are referencing, check out the [Arcadia Rising scenario](http://arcnet.mit.edu/arcadia-scenario.pdf).
