<p>Also suggested by Oleksandr Manzyuk</p>

<p>Context: ITA Software is being bought up by Google.</p>

<p>QPX, written in Lisp, is the cash cow</p>

<p>RES, written for Air Canada (but running into difficulties, including Air Canada trying to get rid of the project); branching out into different languages. Seeing things like components prototyped in Python and not performing adequately (blithe suggestion: rewrite in C++. Not an option!)</p>

<p>What's it like to be in a situation where you're learning so much domain specific knowledge about the airline industry, which you're pretty sure long-term you are not going to be interested in?</p>

<p>Scala and Clojure being used by some of the performance team: can afford to do this since we develop our tools in-house. Edward today would have no problem working on these; didn't manage to get to Scala and Clojure took some bit of ramp-up time; probably is kind of hard to find these types of engineers!</p>

<p>Friday lunch. Yum!</p>

<p>Lyme disease yo.</p>

<p>Adam was a big chess enthusiast, which is what they'd play at lunch. Some discussions about Haskell (I was still learning back then too!) shared shrugs about monads, not understanding it well enough</p>

<p>I hate blogging about my job: don't know what's confidential or not.</p>

<p>Navigating the labyrinth of offices to find the person who I need to ask a certain question to.</p>

<p>Internship not-so-good: having to rewrite last year's intern's code.</p>

<p>Mythical intern who cranked out an iPhone app, which none of the current employees really knew enough about or were interested in. The ability to impress current employees even as an intern (as far as I can tell, I had a very solid internship but I don't think I really impressed anyone. I'm trying to change this)</p>

<p>Nerf guns in the office. Still bigger company, kind of lonelier.</p>

<p>Never had a chance to chat with the CEO/CTO. Didn't know enough to really know what to chat about. But went upstairs to ask about some database aspects, and the resident database expert (you knew because he had a really generic username) came down and gave me a book on Oracle.</p>

<p>Experimental method in software. (Sharding, running tests)</p>

<p>Weekly performance team meetings, one person phoning in. Adam Fletcher running the meeting. Really smart people, who thought a lot about when benchmarks were not valid.</p>

<p>Spinning time waiting on other people, how I passed time. How I wasted a week setting up my Java environment.</p>

<p>Speculation on cultures (Google vs. ITA Software)</p>
