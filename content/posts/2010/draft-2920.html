Here are a list of tips for setting up a Windows build server that integrates with an existing Unix environment using a combination of MinGW and Cygwin (and how to prevent yourself from mixing the two up!)

1. *Get remote desktop functionality.* One notable thing Cygwin will not give you is a way to interact with the Windows graphical user interface, which you will invariably want to do with certain tasks (like installing software). If you happen to have a Professional (or better) copy of Windows, you don’t even have to download any extra software: you can use the built-in *Windows Remote Services*, which is extremely well integrated with the platform (and performs much more smoothly than I remember TightVNC doing.) Just go to *System Properties > Remote > Remote Desktop.*

2. *Get the ability to SSH in.* SSH is the lingua franca of remote computing in the Linux world, and as a command line user I want most of time to be spent in a Unix shell on my usual terminal. However, 

configure ssh

cyglsa-config

ssh-host-config

replicate user account information

turn off Windows Firewall (or poke a hole for port 22) and Windows Defender

bashrc make control-arrow work

setup TEMP/TMP/TMPDIR to explicitly point to /tmp

careful about tty versus notty, prevailing advice incorrect

set TERM properly

Git and SSH don't work http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2010-01/msg00348.html

allow for clean-room MingW development without cygwin

open question: cannot get terminal info problem
