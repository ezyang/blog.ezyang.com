        I'd love to see a high level overview of the various type extensions for ghc.  I've no idea when I should or could be considering GADTs, or type families, or functional dependencies, or ...
        
        There seems to be decent detailed information about each of these, which can be overwhelming when you're not sure where to start.  I'd like to know how these extensions relate to each other; do they solve the same problems, or are they mutually exclusive?

        I'd be quite interested by "intermediate" constructions from category theory. I've seen that comonads appear from time to time (pointed lists...) but what do they have in a common from a programmer's point of view ?
        
        And also, how is Galois ?
        
        Thanks !

Taking a page from [Raymond Chen’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/25/166545.aspx), please post suggestions for future blog posts by me. What would you like to see me explain? What do you think would be amusing if I attempted to write a post about it? Topics I am inclined to cover:

- Almost anything about Haskell, GHC and closely related maths.
- General programming topics.
- Educating, teaching, lecturing.
- Computer science topics of general interest.
- Stories about my internship experiences (at this point, I've interned at [OmniTI](http://omniti.com/), [ITA Software](http://www.itasoftware.com/), [Ksplice](http://www.ksplice.com/) and [Galois](http://www.galois.com/).)
- SIPB.
- Music.

Since Raymond is famous and I’m not, I will be much less choosy about which suggestions I will post about.
