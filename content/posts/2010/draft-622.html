<p>This was meant as a follow-up to our conversation with Oleg. I should revisit those emails and try to figure out what I meant by transformers as types; it might have been the fact that label :: m (m ()) was a kind of static type marker for me to go and look for (one that is isomorphic to a certain stack, but you could imagine newtype'ing it so it was stack agnostic.</p>
