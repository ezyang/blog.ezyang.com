For my [new job](https://github.com/ezyang/pytorch/), I have recently been writing C++. And as any dutiful Haskeller, I have asked myself, "How can I make my C++ data structures immutable?" And then, because I want my coworkers to actually accept my pull requests, I have to also add, "While still writing idiomatic C++?"

The tool in a C++ programmers toolbox for achieving this is the `const` keyword.
