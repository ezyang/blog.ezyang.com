Something that I’ve noticed that I have to repeatedly explain about our new module system for Haskell is, “But why not type classes?” An intellectually lazy response is, “Well, have you ever *tried* doing it that way?”

Go's interface model Too many too few? Implementation, swap it out, have it still satisfy

Why are typeclasses insufficient for some use-cases of swappable components?

So what gets hard when you have types involved?

typeclasses are nominal What PROBLEMS happen when you move to a more STRUCTURAL notion?
