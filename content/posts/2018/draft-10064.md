One of the great benefits of open source software is that it is forkable: if there is a bug you need to fix, or an enhancement you need to make, you can fork the software, make your change, and use it locally. This makes software flexible in a way infrastructure is not: if your continuous integration server is a bespoke Linux box cloistered away in someone's apartment, you can't just fork the server if it's being dumb or annoying.

Or can you?

Infrastructure is really expensive.
