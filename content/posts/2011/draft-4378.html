So, historically, when we want to write clear code, we pay a performance cost, and if we want it fast, we have to destruct it into      
       low-level code. But what if we wrote clear code, and then wrote appropriate optimizations (rewrites) to make it into the fast code?

oddly enough, literally the second before i read what you said, i was thinking about what it might be like to have an interactive session  
       with the compiler's optimizer to have kind of a back-and-forth conversation about program transformations 

anyway, my idea is that maybe there could be the programmer-visible code and some other files representing the transformations that the programmer 
       was wanting the compiler to use where the latter stuff is generated via an interactive session

Yeah. I'm not sure how well this would work when you want to go and change the code, but I guess you could have the compiler tell you   
       what transforms stopped firing.

no, even better than that... when you compile, any time something has changed you get a chance to interact with the compiler to tell it    
       how you want the new parts to be treated

and of course you could also force it

but anyway, i think the interactivity would be a cool way to not only have fine-grained control over optimizations, but also have a way for the    
       compiler to *remind* you of potentially useful transformations. currently we have to do all the thinking about rewrite rules ourselves without     
       even getting to see the various stages of optimizations

and of course we are also limited to basically just things like rewrite rules. this might open doors to other kinds of transformations, maybe      
       safer or more general

this of course would cater to the kinds of people that like or need to superoptimize, but it could probably be made to work with more typical      
       workflows somehow
