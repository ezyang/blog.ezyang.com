We emerged from our concurrent and distributed systems lecture, with the vague feeling that nothing had actually been learned. This was surprising to me, because I think concurrent and distributed systems are pretty interesting, and that the material would have been useful way back when I was a freshman at MIT, grappling with the vagaries of AFS, Kerberos and LDAP. But the information transfer of the lecture series seemed to be asymptotically approaching zero (and not even because the lecturer was particularly bad.)

One of my classmates complained to me about this after we had reviewed our problem set work, and I tried to put my finger on precisely what was wrong with the course.
