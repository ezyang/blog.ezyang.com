A statement that has always puzzled me is the following quote from *Types and Programming Languages*: “Although it is a little less familiar than induction, the principle of coinduction is central to many areas of computer science; for example, it is the main proof technique in theories of concurrency based on bisimulation, and it lies at the heart of many model checking algorithms.” Whoa, whoa, whoa! Coinduction? Bisimulation? Big words. Clearly I was not ready to understand greatest fixed points.

Actually, coinduction is pretty manageable if you work in a finite domain.
