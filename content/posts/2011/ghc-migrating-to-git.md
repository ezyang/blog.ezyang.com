      content: "Git Interoperability is the one thing I'm most eager to see in Darcs now. I would love for us to bring the everything-is-a-patch UI simplicity to Git repositories.  It may take us a while, but I think this is the long term target to shoot for, being able to use Darcs interchangeably with Git."

From `cvs-ghc@haskell.org`:

    Hi all,

    We now plan to do the git switchover this Thursday, 31 March.

    Thanks
    Ian

There are some things that I will miss from Darcs (`darcs send` and the cases where "everything is a patch" actually does work well), but all and all I’m quite pleased to see GHC moving to Git.
