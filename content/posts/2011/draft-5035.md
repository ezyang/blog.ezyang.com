In today’s addition to this series, we work on developing a correspondence between Haskell source code and our visual shenanigans on the Haskell Heap. The idea is to develop an intuition for what certain programming constructs mean in terms of runtime behavior, so that we can look at code that profiling has found to be problematic and divine what the necessary changes are in one go.
