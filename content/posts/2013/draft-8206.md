Stanford is a member of [Ecma International](http://www.ecma-international.org/default.htm), the standards body behind, among other things, ECMAScript (aka JavaScript), but it’s been a while since we’ve had any folks actively participating in TC39. So when [John Mitchell](http://theory.stanford.edu/people/jcm/) asked me and [Deian](http://www.scs.stanford.edu/~deian/) whether or not we wanted to sit in on a meeting which was occurring in sunny California, we said, “Heck yeah!” \[1\]

\[1\] Well, paraphrased.
