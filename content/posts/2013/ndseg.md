        It's not about focus. The 1st essay was entirely focused. Because it sets out to do the opposite of the buried nugget in that massive pgbovine link: "Don't just make it all me, me, me."
        
        Briefly the proposal reads: "I did this and I did that. I worked on this and I worked on this. I enjoyed this and I enjoyed that." The reader ends up screaming, "You unmitigated ass!" [1] The writer's laser-focused on asking for money to fuel some ongoing solipsistic head trip, money equally well-spent feeding a junkie's habit.

Humbly presented for your consideration: [Exhibit A](http://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/ndseg-goals.pdf), an NDSEG essay that did not get accepted; [Exhibit B](http://web.mit.edu/~ezyang/Public/ndseg2012-4.pdf), an NDSEG essay that did get accepted. It’s pretty cool what making a statement more focused can do. (See also [Philip Guo’s page on the topic.](http://www.pgbovine.net/fellowship-tips.htm))
