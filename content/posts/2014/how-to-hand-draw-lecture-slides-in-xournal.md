A while ago, I wrote a post about [how I make most of the diagrams on this blog using Xournal.](http://blog.ezyang.com/2010/04/diagramming-in-xournal-and-gimp/) I also make all of my presentation and lecture slides in a (customized) Xournal, although the process is a little different. It actually works quite well for me, so I thought I’d describe how I do it.

# Setting the page size

The first thing to do is change the size of your pages into a more slide-like format. While you might be tempted to set your size to the standard size of 10in by 7.5in, I've found that it's a lot more convenient if the entire canvas fits on my screen, even with Xournal's toolbars visible. 8in by 6in, which has the same aspect ratio, fits nicely, and I keep a small Xournal file `blank-slides.xoj` as a template for my projects.

# Making build slides

One of the things that I frequently need

paste-in-place duplicate slide

# Slides for reading
