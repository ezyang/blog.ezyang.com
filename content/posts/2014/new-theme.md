        Hey Edward,
        
        Nice new theme. There's just a little problem under Safari. The "Leave a Comment" box there overlaps with the Name box: https://www.dropbox.com/s/3cqqxo9o22qpp94/Capture%20d%27écran%202014-07-26%2016.54.31.png
        
        This is under Safari 7.0.2 FWIW.

Hello loyal readers: Inside 206-105 has a new theme! I’m retiring [Manifest](http://themes.jimbarraud.com/manifest/), which was a pretty nice theme but (1) the text size was too small and (2) I decided I didn’t really like the fonts, I’ve reskinned my blog with a theme based on Brent Jackson’s [Ashley](http://jxnblk.com/ashley/), but ported to work on Wordpress. I hope you like it, and please report any rendering snafus you might notice on older pages. Thanks!
