The free information paradox is very simple: given that “information wants to be free”, how should

The catch phrase "information wants to be free" refers to two things. The first is the fact that digital information is cheap to reproduce and transfer, meaning over time any piece of information will become widely distributed. The second is the judgment (informed by this physical fact) that

On the one hand information wants to be expensive, because it's so valuable. The right information in the right place just changes your life. On the other hand, information wants to be free, because the cost of getting it out is getting lower and lower all the time. So you have these two fighting against each other.

    (1) Because the natural state of information is free, once we let information
    out, there is nothing we can (or should) do about it.

    This is true, but there are multiple levels of "out".  "Out" to Google
    implies "out" to Big Brother, and "out" to Facebook implies "out" to
    Big Brother, but I don't think Facebook and Google share with each
    other.  And neither of those necessarily implies "out" to your boss.

      This implies that
    citizens concerned about their privacy should make drastic, day-to-day changes
    to their behavior, refusing to put anything they wish to keep private in
    digital form.

    That is a step too far.  I don't think there is a need to avoid putting
    anything sensitive in digital form.  Just don't put it on any computer
    except your own, or send it encrypted to specific people you are
    working on it with.

    What we must be careful of is having it in a computer with nonfree software
    or storing it in network sites.

    Basically, that statement greatly oversimplifies.

    (2) With the rise of big data and sophisticated statistical analysis of
    transactions I make with companies, data I wish to keep private may leak
    out anyway, over extended periods of time.

    I do not follow you.  I think you need to be more concrete.

    I won't be in my office any time soon.

        In general, we should assume that entities with more resources (computational,
        monetary, etc) are more able to acquire information that are at lower levels
        of "out".

    Not always.  Big Brother can collect data from companies by means of
    the PAT RIOT act, but companies' ability to get data is much more
    limited.

        However, if we buy into (1), I don't think there is any expectation of privacy
        for information publishes in semi-public venues (e.g. Google Plus circles), and
        people should stop behaving as if there is.                                              
    I agree.

    For teaching people this, it helps not to exaggerate it, because then
    (1) that increases what you're asking them to do, which means more   
    reason for them to refuse to do it, and (2) they will react against
    the exaggeration by distrusting you.

        The point is that while local action may buy you small amounts of privacy
        in the short term, it is a losing strategy in the long term.

    Maybe, but we can't be sure about the long term.  Anyway, local action
    is the way to teach people to defend their privacy, and that's what
    we need in order to build a movement that can achieve anything.
