*Every day I’m shufflin’...*

A little while back, I described how to use [secure multi-party sorting](http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/07/secure-multiparty-bitcoin-anonymization/) to implement a mixing protocol for Bitcoin anonymization. I have since chatted with some members of the anonymity and cryptography community who are familiar with this problem, and I was pleased to discover that there exist protocols that are more efficient and more anonymous than the Jónsson construction we described in the previous post. In this post, I’d like to describe some of the ongoing research in this area on the **secure shuffle** problem.
