<p>Design of a programming language, but for programmers. Insights from 'Insane Asylum'</p>

<p>Tension of what is easy to implement and what is easy to use
Thesis of book: if you change the design process, you can make these coincide
Dancing bear metaphor
Cognitive friction
It's simply not enough to code it up, and add "an interface". Interface is fundamental to how software is put together
Iteration and the myth of the unpredictable market
Prototyping is expensive
How (Email|Scheduling|Calendar) programs fail
Software forgets (we learn about software, why not vice versa), is lazy, is parsimonious with information (doesn't say what's happening. from the perspective the user cares about), is inflexible, blames users (crash), won't take responsibility (dialog boxes)
Simplicity v Control, Success v Understanding, Possible v Probable (Security?)
Persona (a "cognitive handle" on the target audience)
Tasks != Goals
Polite software is interested in me, deferential, forthcoming, has common sense, anticipates my needs, responsive, taciturn about its personal problems, well informed, perceptive, self-confident, focused, fudgable, gives instant gratification, is trustworthy
Advocacy for design documents</p>
