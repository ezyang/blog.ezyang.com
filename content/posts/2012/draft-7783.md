I went through my first paper submission process recently (here's to a successful submission!) and the experience has left me some interesting thoughts about the nature of the paper. Probably the most awkward thought is this: *this paper is kind of mediocre.*

What do I mean by this, and aren’t I being incredibly unfair to my coauthors? (There are a lot of coauthors on this one.) And I don’t think the execution of the paper is bad at all either; the introduction is beautifully written, the implementation work was fine, I’m fairly proud of some of the empirical tests: all of the components are fine, and the basic idea is nice, simple and novel. Nor is the problem an uninteresting one; we had plenty of lively conversations and in the process of writing the paper we discovered some very interesting future avenues which we will probably chase down as future work. It would totally pass the bar of “good blog post”—and maybe I will blog about it.

But the problem lies here: it seems the work spent evaluating, formalizing and implementing this solution was not commensurate with the “Wow!” factor of the result. I think that the main idea could have been adequately communicated in a few paragraphs, some sample code, and maybe a little bit of empirical data about the solution as we implemented it. But from my perspective, half of the paper is all posturing to get the paper accepted by appropriate academic circles.

One reason I’ve heard about why all of this extra scaffolding is necessary is because it serves as an indirect indicator of the quality of the work that was done. Starting with a simple question: does it even work? If it only worked accidentally, that’s a bad place to be in. Or, a well written introduction can serve to help out someone new to the field who is trying to fill their way around: the introductions are more important than the actual results of the paper! That is to say, a function of the paper is to summarize previous work. But here, it seems to me that there is a lot of duplication of work; wouldn’t a wiki be much better at capturing evolving ideas about what a paper means?

The concept of the paper as a unit seems to have a bit of utility: a paper is self-contained in some sense, and thus can be the unit of a discussion without having to tell someone to go read a textbook (of course, all papers make assumptions about what field you are in, and are not penetrable to people outside the field.)

But all-in-all, it seems communication is hard, and even if your result is a small, cute result which should be incorporated in the literature but probably isn’t going to shake the foundations of fields pretty soon (hey, that sounds like most scientific publications) then most of your effort is actually going to be spent building up all of the scaffolding that surrounds your result. Or maybe the result is really hard, but only in some narrow technical sense that doesn’t generalize easily; I haven’t written a paper of that type, although I hear things are always too complicated, even if you (the researcher) think they are simple.

Maybe this is why the most important theorems that everyone use are so frequently just “lemmas”, embedded inside more complicated proofs.

XXX At various points during the paper writing process, I would repeatedly say, “I don’t believe in this!”
