A friend asked me this: *Does a paper, even one accepted at a prestigious conference, have more or less impact than a widely-read blog?*

In terms of numbers, it seems clear the blog wins. But maybe that's not the most important property. Who is it most important to impact?

- You?
- Your advisor?
- Your research group?
- Practicing academics in your specialty? (Why are they important?)
- Practicing academics in the general field?
- The tenure committee at a university?
- Your funding agency?
- Industrial practitioners in your specialty?
- Industrial practitioners in your general field? Even if they misunderstand you?
- The Internet? (Does this include your advisor? Your practicing academics?)
- Politicians? Wealthy people? The military? (Other people with power?)
- The general public?
- The general public, but only in the form of a one sentence soundbite?
- Children?

What impact should it have? That is, how does it impart value? By being:

- Read by your advisor?
- Read by your research group?
- Used to bring a collaborator up to speed?
- Peer reviewed by small number of people?
- Read closely by only a small number of smart people?
- Accepted to a minor conference?
- Accepted to a major conference?
- Perceived as Impressive? Approachable? Foundational? Practical?
- Given to undergraduates as part of the curriculum of a subject?
- Given to undergraduates to implement?
- Distributed on paper?
- Distributed on a website?
- Distributed on a blog? On Google Plus?
- Skimmed?
- Read in depth?
- Cited by someone who didn't read your paper?
- Cited by someone who did?
- Based off of for further academic work?
- Inspiring to a new generation?
- Unread, but widely regarded by important people?
- Widely implemented in industry?

If we wanted to optimize for impact, what should we do?

- Articulate a complicated idea in a comprehensive and clear way?
- Articulate a simple but non-obvious idea?
- Generate certificates (e.g. studies, close developments) of simple ideas which can now be taken for granted?
- Make a tool that people can use?
- Describe technical skills which are widely applicable?
- Write a paper that more people could understand? For example, a position paper? An empirical study? A survey paper?
- Generate parcels of knowledge (e.g. sound bites, examples, paradoxes) which are accessible?
- Conduct meta-analysis on the literature to increase accuracy of results?
- Make an improvement to a system people already use?
- Tell a story?

But what signals do we use to approximate the impact of a paper? Are they any good?

- Publication in a prestigious conference?
- Citations?
- Reputation of the researcher?
- Usage of some product within the academic community? Within the greater community?
- The opinion of someone who read the paper closely? Who didn't read the paper closely? Who only attended the conference talk?
- Awareness of the paper in the academic community? After twenty years?

How does a person tell what impact he values? How does he find out what other people value? How much is he supposed to cater for those values, in order to generate the right signals? How does he know he won't have more impact by working outside of academia, either in industry, or as an entrepreneur, or in a non-profit? How does he come to terms with the fact that more people will spend more hours watching My Little Pony than reading and thinking about his paper? How does he know that they would, in fact, get commensurate value, if they had read his paper instead of watching My Little Pony? If someone tells him that it's more important to talk to people at conferences than attend talks, what does that mean on the value of talks? What does it mean that people listen to the talks anyway? Is it important to worry about impact, shouldn't you just do what you enjoy? Is impact even important? What is the meaning of the scientific endeavor?

I asked the Buddha, but he only replied with one word: *Mu.*

"I simply don't have time to look at every paper that passes a sanity check and determine if it's actually interesting. What else would serve that function in your ideal world? The fact that they sometimes fail to select the best papers is to be expected. There are well-known examples of great old papers getting rejected a couple times before finally getting accepted. What more can one realistically expect?"

"I would argue that the answer to the second is to bring a community of active researchers together to talk shop. This means that in answering your first question: controversial papers should be valued, "position" papers should be encouraged (even if they are light on theorems) and epsilon-papers should be discouraged. I don't mean that epsilon-papers are "bad", of course science is based on epsilons. It is just that they are inherently unsuitable as conference presentations, see: <http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2011/9/122805-are-you-talking-to-me/fulltext>"
