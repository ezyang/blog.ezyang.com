Def. graduate level class (although often populated with some undergraduates) culminating with a publication in a workshop

Tips and pointers
* As a new associate professor, you are not currently advising any students. Use this as an opportunity to use your extra time to really supervise the teams. Deliverables are not a lot: you need to sit down and hack on code with the students, especially when there are tough technical issues involved.
* Have multi-person teams. Not because they'll actually get more work done collaborating (one of the students will probably flake), but because it reduces your workload
* Don't aim too high
* The students have to buy into the project, but it's only likely to work if it's a good idea that you've been thinking about for a bit. Give the illusion of choice by offering them ten or so choices.
* Creating things completely from scratch is kind of hard. Students may have better luck with incremental changes, or creating variations on a theme which already exists
* Give everyone As
* You really need to work very hard on the project. This needs to be spread out over time.
